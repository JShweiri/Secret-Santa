<ul>
<li>The update page now only shows your information, allowing a more magical experience.
<li>Wish list form is now larger, allows for multiple lines, scrolling, and even resizing.
<li><b>Support for links!</b>
</ul>
It's not recommended but if you prefer the old look use <a href="updateOLD.php">this link</a> (This link does not support newlines, scrolling, resizing or links. As a result it may look and act strange)
